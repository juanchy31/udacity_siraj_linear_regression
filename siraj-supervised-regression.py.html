# In this exercise we will be predicting an animal body weight 
# based on it brain's weight. 

# Since the data is labeled, this is a supervised approach
# The type of machine learning task that we will use is called
# Regresion

# Import required libraries

# Pandas lets us read our dataset
import pandas as pd 

# Machine learning library used for this exercise
from sklearn import linear_model

# Let us visualize our model and data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# In[4]:


# Read data from github repository
datafram = pd.read_fwf('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanchy31/udacity_siraj_linear_regression/master/brain_body.txt')


# In[5]:


datafram.head()


# In[6]:


# Parse and read both measurements in two different variables
x_values = datafram[['Brain']]


# In[7]:


y_values = datafram[['Body']]


# In[9]:


# Now we have data that we can plot on a graph using x and y
# coordinates

# Now we train model on the data.
# First, create the LinearRegression variable 

body_reg = linear_model.LinearRegression()

# Now we are going to find the line of best fit for our model
# based on our x,y value pairs

body_reg.fit(x_values,y_values)

# Visualize the results on a matplotlib scatter graph
# For every x y value we have, predict the associated y value
# and draw a line that intersect all those points

plt.scatter(x_values,y_values)
plt.plot(x_values, body_reg.predict(x_values))
plt.show()

# Our regression line fits most of the data very well, and there 
# seems to be a very strong correlation between brain and body 
# weights.

# Linear Regression finds the line of best fit using the equation:
# Y = mx + b, where b is the y, m measures how steep. 
# This equation is called equation of a line, or Linear Equation.
